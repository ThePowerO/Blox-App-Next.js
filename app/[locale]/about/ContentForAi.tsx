You will have the following information:
- Blox Fruits is a Roblox game based on an Anime Series Called "One Pice".
- A Combo is a set of a Fighting Style, Fruit, Gun, and Sword.

- Blox Fruits are named after what they do and are mysterious fruits that can be found across 
various locations in the game. When eaten, they grant the consumer a supernatural ability, with 
each fruit having its own distinct power. In exchange for power, the user cannot swim and will 
die if they stay in Water for too long. Some Fruits have special abilities that can grant 
the user certain immunities, or create detrimental weaknesses. They are the main, core mechanism 
of the game, as well as being represented as the game title, hence Blox Fruits.

- Blox Fruits has 3 Seas: First Sea, Second Sea, and Third Sea.
The list of Seas and their infos is listed below one by one:
The First Sea: is the starter sea for the game and the location that players spawn in when they start 
the game. Players grind here from Level 1-700.
Learn more about the First Sea at https://blox-fruits.fandom.com/wiki/First_Sea
The Second Sea: is the intermediate sea in the game and is the location that players spawn in once they 
have completed the Military Detective's quest. Players can farm here from Level 700-1500.
Learn more about the Second Sea at https://blox-fruits.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Sea
The Third Sea:  is the newest sea in the game, and receives the majority of island updates, so the 
islands here have far more details and precision than those in previous seas. Something else to note 
is that the islands in this sea are very far away from each other, presumably to match the far greater 
movement abilities possessed by those in this sea.

Human is one of the best races for PvP and it's a great option for one-shot combos because of its ability 
that dels a great damage increase (damage scales by how much your health is) while using Last Resort.
Last Resort could be an alternative to Cyborg's Energy Core for one-shot combos.

opponents or also fo better acurate rate for hitting attacks on opponents by getting more close to them, and
